## Overview

Practice UNO R4 basics with onboard LED PWM fading and a button input. This exercise reinforces pin configuration, reading digital inputs, and using PWM outputs.

## Code Explained

- Configures the onboard LED (`D13`) and an external button.
- Fades the LED when the button is pressed via a PWM ramp.
- Provides serial feedback for state changes.

## How To Use

- Connect a button to `D7` (use external pull-down or internal pull-up if adapted).
- Use onboard LED at `D13` for visual feedback.
- Adjust timings and behavior in the `.c` file.
